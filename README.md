# MPL - A message passing library

MPL is a message passing library written in C++11 based on the MPI 
(Message Passing Interface) standard.  Since the C++ API has been dropped 
from the MPI standard in version 3.0 it is the aim of MPL is to provide a 
modern C++ message passing library for high performance computing.

MPL will neither brinng all functions of the C language API to C++ nor 
provide a direct mapping of the C API to some C++ functions and classes. 
Its focus is on the MPI core functions, ease of use, type safety, and 
elegance.
